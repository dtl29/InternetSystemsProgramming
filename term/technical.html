    <p>This website was created by: Daniel Louis.</p><br />
    <p>The architecture of this project was created with php, html, and javascript. Along with a database. In order to create a four tier architecture website
    <br /> The database schema is made out of three tables: 
    <br /> Decks(name, nameOfCreator, primaryCard, decklist), 
    <br />DeckUsers(id,username, password, email), 
    <br /> and Cards(name, cmc(converted mama cost), cardType, color, legalBrawl, legalComander... power, rarity, setName, toughness, image).</p>
    <p>The Cards table's attributes are all the identifiers for the card within the game to have a better look up for the user, so
        <br /> the user can look up what card they need easier.</p><br />
